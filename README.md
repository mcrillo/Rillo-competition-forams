Code to produce analyses and figures of the paper

Work in progress. I am currently cleaning the R code that reads all open-data I used in this project from their online repositories instead of providing the data again myself. 
This process is to ensure that correct credit is given to those who have previously published the data. If you urgently need/want to re-run my analyses, please contact me.
